## Findings
Taking part in this project helped me gain a more hands-on experience with the concepts 
Iâ€™ve been covering in class over the course of this semester. Creating my own 
pharmaceutical management inventory from scratch helped me apply the foundation and 
frameworks of Python and object oriented progaming by going through the process 
involved in creating a coding project such as planning, researching, and debugging. Some 
limitations I faced during implementation was working between several different classes  
simoustanelsy and handling the various different eros in order to ensure data consistency 
throughout the project.
