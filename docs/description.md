# Description
This pharmaceutical management inventory system was created in Python using 
object-oriented programming (OOP) as a project for my CMPSC 132-002: Programming
and Computation II: Data Structures course, taught by Professor Janghoon Yang. Utilizing 
the power of OOP this project manages the inventory of a pharmaceutical company by 
allowing users to create Items objects that represent and handle their respective 
medications created. These objects are then used to form the actual inventory of the 
pharmaceutical company which can be truncated, lengthed, updated, etcâ€¦ to facilitate 
practical uses and scenarios in a real-world efficient inventory management system. 
Reports can then be generated, providing insights into the inventory status.
